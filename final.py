        To Do:
            - load/read the Caltech-101 dataset

            - divide the data into training/testing (70% of images should go to the training set, 30% to testing)
        Useful:

            - use k-means algorithm to group features into "dictionary_size" groups
        Useful:

            - for every image go through "k" SIFT features that describes it
            - every image will be described by a single vector of length "dictionary_size"
            and every entry in that vector will indicate how many times a SIFT feature from a particular
            "visual group" (one of "dictionary_size") appears in the image. Non-appearing features are set to zeros.
        Input:

        Input:
            inputs: new features (converted using the dictionary) of size n_images x dictionary_size
